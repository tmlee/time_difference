# TimeDifference

TimeDifference is the missing Ruby method to calculate difference between two given time. You can do a Ruby time difference in year, month, week, day, hour, minute, and seconds.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'time_difference'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

### Works for Time, DateTime, and Date

```ruby
# Time
start_time = Time.new(2013,1)
end_time = Time.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_years
=> 1.0

# DateTime
start_time = DateTime.new(2013,1)
end_time = DateTime.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_years
=> 1.0

# Date
start_time = Date.new(2013,1)
end_time = Date.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_years
=> 1.0
```

### Get the time difference in various units

```ruby
start_time = Time.new(2013,1)
end_time = Time.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_years
=> 1.0

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_months
=> 12.0

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_weeks
=> 52.14 

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_days
=> 365.0 

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_hours
=> 8760.0

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_minutes
=> 525600.0

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_seconds
=> 31536000.0 
```

### Get the time difference in each component

```ruby
start_time = Time.new(2013,1)
end_time = Time.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_each_component
=> {:years=>1.0, :months=>12.0, :weeks=>52.14, :days=>365.0, :hours=>8760.0, :minutes=>525600.0, :seconds=>31536000.0}
```

### If you would like an overall estimated time component, use `in_general` _(not that accurate)_

```ruby
start_time = Time.new(2013,1)
end_time = Time.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).in_general
=> {:years=>0, :months=>12, :weeks=>0, :days=>5, :hours=>0, :minutes=>0, :seconds=>0}
```

### You can also get `in_general` as a human readable string, using `humanize`

```ruby
start_time = Time.new(2013,1)
end_time = Time.new(2014,1)

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).humanize
=> "12 Months and 5 Days"

The :only and :except options can be used to limit the components included

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).humanize(only: [:months])
=> "12 Months"

TimeDifference.between(start_time, end_time).humanize(except: [:months])
=> "5 Days"
```
